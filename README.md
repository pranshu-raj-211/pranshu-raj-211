# 👋 Hey, I'm Pranshu

I build real-time systems, intelligent agents, and infrastructure that scales.


I'm currently focused on:
- ⚡ Real-time systems: websockets, pub/sub, distributed backends
- ♟️ A tiny open-source Lichess clone — local-first, scalable, and minimal


Recently released [concall-parser](https://pypi.org/project/concall-parser/), a python package to get structured features from earnings call reports. Made in collaboration with [Jay Shah](https://github.com/JS12540/).

## 🧠 Learning + Deep Work

- Diving deep into how Lichess works — game servers, move validation, and scaling multiplayer chess
- Exploring ML inference infra — model servers, autoscaling, request batching
- Studying database internals — data modeling, indexing, replication

## 🚀 Projects I've worked on
- **AI Research Assistant**  
  Turn research papers into structured insights using local LLMs, vector search, and semantic chunking.  
  _Tech:_ Python, Ollama, MongoDB, FastAPI

- **Real-Time Leaderboard Engine**  
  Matchmaking + scoring using Go, Redis, and Docker. Built for low-latency, high-concurrency use.  
  _Tech:_ Go, Redis, Prometheus, Docker

- **Multi-Agent Recommender System**  
  Recommend users to users using OpenAI agents, MongoDB vector search, and intelligent prompts.  
  _Tech:_ OpenAI API, Docker, AWS, FastAPI

- **Forex Trading Bot**  (Currently undergoing refactoring, previous design was terrible)
  Streaming market data + trade signals using Python & GCP Pub/Sub.  
  _Tech:_ Python, Pub/Sub, Docker, Dash

- **Web Scraping** (Multiple projects)
  Built scrapers to fetch jobs from indeed and YCombinator, to match against a resume reducing time spent searching for jobs.
  _Tech:_ Python, Taipy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
