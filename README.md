# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Pranshu

I build backend systems that work at scale.
Previously worked with Python, Go, real time communication, infra, and production ready AI products.


I'm currently focused on:
- Building a scalable real-time leaderboard using SSE.
- Voice agent evals at work.
- Diving deep into databases, contributing to open source.

## Projects I've worked on

- [Real-Time Leaderboard](https://github.com/pranshu-raj-211/leaderboard)

  Send ranking updates to 28k+ concurrent SSE clients using Go, Redis Sorted Sets, and Prometheus.
  Optimized Docker images(48x size reduction, 46% build time reduced), structured logs, and system metrics for observability.
  Tech: Go, Redis, Prometheus, Docker, Grafana, PostgreSQL

- Multi-Agent Recommender System

  Built for a business-matching use case - uses OpenAI LLMs for DB query generation from natural language.
  FastAPI backend + MongoDB search with cron jobs to sync with Zapier tables.
  Tech: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Docker

- [Concall Parser (OSS Package)](https://github.com/JS12540/concall-parser)

  Python package to extract structured data from earnings call transcripts using hybrid regex + LLM.
  480+ downloads. Built with test automation (pytest regressions) & CI on GitHub Actions.
  Tech: Python, LLMs, Regex, GitHub Actions
