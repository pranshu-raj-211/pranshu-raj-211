# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Pranshu

I build backend systems that work at scale.
Previously worked with Python, Go, real time communication, infra, and production ready AI products.


I'm currently focused on:
- Real-time systems: Building a scalable real-time leaderboard using SSE.
- Scalable AI Products: Turning ML into usable software. Built and deployed voice AI agents, vector search, text to SQL services to production.
- Systems Internals: Deep dives into how databases and observability works at a lower level.

Recent post on [optimizing Docker image builds for image size and build time](https://blog.pranshu-raj.me/posts/optimizing-docker-builds/)

Recently released [concall-parser](https://pypi.org/project/concall-parser/), a python package to get structured features from earnings call reports. Made in collaboration with [Jay Shah](https://github.com/JS12540/).

## Projects I've worked on

- **Real-Time Leaderboard**
  Send ranking updates to 28k+ concurrent SSE clients using Go, Redis Sorted Sets, and Prometheus.
  Optimized Docker images(48x size reduction, 46% build time reduced), structured logs, and system metrics for observability.
  Tech: Go, Redis, Prometheus, Docker, Grafana, PostgreSQL

- **Multi-Agent Recommender System**
  Built for a business-matching use case - uses OpenAI LLMs for DB query generation from natural language.
  FastAPI backend + MongoDB search with cron jobs to sync with Zapier tables.
  Tech: Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, Docker

- Concall Parser (OSS Package)
  Python package to extract structured data from earnings call transcripts using hybrid regex + LLM.
  480+ downloads. Built with test automation (pytest regressions) & CI on GitHub Actions.
  Tech: Python, LLMs, Regex, GitHub Actions
