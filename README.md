# **Hi there! ðŸ‘‹**  
Iâ€™m Pranshu, a junior at IIIT Gwalior pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science.  

I love solving complex problems, designing scalable systems, and optimizing them for real-world performance. My focus is on backend engineering, distributed systems, and high-performance computing, but Iâ€™m always exploring new tech that catches my interest.  

---

## **ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On**  
- **Building real-world systems** â€“ data pipelines, search engines, and recommendation engines that solve business problems.  
- **Exploring real-time data movement** â€“ batch, microbatch, and streaming systems along with Apache Kafka.  
- **Optimizing for performance & scale** â€“ designing backends that handle high-throughput workloads efficiently.
- Creating a simplified open source version of Lichess (I plan on calling it tinychess).

## **ðŸ“– What Iâ€™m Learning**  
- Go - It's interesting, much more performant than Python. I'll be working on scaling backend servers in this, go has a great ecosystem.
- **On-Demand Compute & Scaling** â€“ spinning up and managing workloads dynamically using Kubernetes.  
- **Real-Time Systems** â€“ scaling websockets and sse, I'm currently trying to horizontally scale them using HAproxy and doing perf on it.  
- **Efficient Storage & Indexing** â€“ working with databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. I'm also improving my data modeling knowledge.

## **ðŸ›  Stuff Iâ€™ve Built**  
- **Multi-Agent Recommendation System** â€“ Used OpenAI APIs, MongoDB vector search, and Docker to recommend user profiles.     
- **Forex Trading Alerts System** â€“ Designed a system using Python and GCP Pub/Sub to detect market trends and send trade signals.
- **RAG pipelines** - Various kinds, I liked working on taking unstructured documents and extracting actionable insights, using non deterministic behaviour of LLMs to do more than what's normally possible.
